# idre-sql-python

These are starter materials for the IDRE workshop on SQL + Python.

To get started, please [CLICK HERE](https://jupyter.idre.ucla.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbenjum%2Fidre-sql-python&urlpath=tree%2Fidre-sql-python%2F), and when asked for authentication, choose 'UCLA' on the CILogon screen.

It may take several minutes for the above link to get your environment started and take you to a Jupyter dashboard.  If the progress bar turns red and gives you an error, you are also welcome to try interacting with the materials via Binder:
